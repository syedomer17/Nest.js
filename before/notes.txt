âœ… 1. Classes and Constructors
ðŸ“˜ What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (data) and methods (functions).

ðŸ“˜ What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method in a class that runs automatically when you create a new object from the class. Itâ€™s used to initialize values.

âœ… 2. Access Modifiers (public, private, readonly)
These define who can access a classâ€™s properties or methods.

Modifier	Meaning
public	(default) Accessible anywhere
private	Accessible only inside the class
readonly	Value cannot be changed after initialization

âœ… 3. Generics (<T>)
Generics let you create reusable components or functions that work with any data type.

âœ… 4. Decorators (Used in NestJS)
A decorator is a special function used to add metadata or modify classes, methods, or properties. In NestJS, youâ€™ll see them everywhere (e.g., @Controller(), @Get()).

Think of a decorator like a label or wrapper that gives extra behavior to something.
